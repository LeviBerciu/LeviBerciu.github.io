                    <br>
                    <p>Welcome to Cluj-Napoca, the vibrant heart of Transylvania!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Join me as we wander through the city’s cobbled streets, uncovering stories that stretch back centuries, from the Romans through medieval times, to a bustling modern city, with a vibrant student life.

                    <h4>2. Tour Begins: Union Square</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>We begin our journey in the heart of Cluj-Napoca, Piața Unirii, or Union Square.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Walk towards the glass-covered rectangular structure rising from the ground in the south of the square, opposite the church and the statue.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As you walk towards it, imagine being in the Roman city of Napoca, at the time of Emperor Trajan. After defeating the “Dacians”, he began transforming this territory into a Roman Province. Later, emperor Hadrian made Napoca a bustling center of trade and lifted it to the rank of “Municípium”. During the rule of Marcus Aurelius, the city was granted the status of “Colōnia” and also reached the highest urban rank attainable at that time.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The city was built around two perpendicular axes, intersecting at the Forum, near today’s church of Saint Michael, which you can see at the northern end of the square. The wealth and prosperity of Napoca during this period was in large part fueled by the trading of salt and precious metals. The Turda Salt Mine near the city is a spectacular testament to the importance of this mineral in the region’s history.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If you’ve arrived at the rectangle in the middle of the square, look through the glass. You can see the remains of buildings from this period. Imagine houses with numerous rooms, underfloor heating, paved interior yards with fountains in the middle; porticoes and columns facing the streets. A true luxury by any standard.  This prosperous Roman period lasted until about 274 AD, when Napoca was abandoned.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While remnants of Roman culture were discovered in the area after this period, the next important phase in the city’s history started in the middle ages, when it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary. At the start of the 13th century it was mentioned as “Castrum Clus” . The origin of the “Clus” name is highly debated, but it is the earliest documented form of the city’s current name.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This was a tumultuous period. The city was raided multiple times by the Mongols, decimating the population. To help repopulate the area, Saxon settlers were invited and given special privileges. Thanks to the rights and freedoms enjoyed by the city’s dwellers, highly influential and wealthy guilds have been established. The city’s walls were built and bastions erected, with different guilds being responsible for their upkeep and for ensuring preparedness in case of a siege. But we’ll talk about that later on our tour.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For now, look around the square. The layout of the streets you see today is pretty much the same as it was back then with Saint Michael’s church to the north and buildings flanking the square on all sides. These days the square is home to numerous events throughout the year such as the Transylvania Film Festival -commonly referred to as TIFF- hosting open-air projections, or the very popular Christmas Market.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Throughout the centuries, the city kept growing in importance and wealth, but it wasn’t spared the great events of history. At the start of the 18th century, it was ravaged by the plague, reducing its population to around 6000. It recovered in the following centuries and moved towards becoming the cultural and educational hub we know today.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The population quickly outgrew the inner city and many of the walls and bastions suffered demolition to make way for modern infrastructure. In the period between the two world wars, the city saw an explosive population growth expanding further and further out from the city center.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The communist era which began after the second world war, saw a doubling of the population to close to 320.000 by 1989. The city became a melting pot for people from all over the country. Industrial sites were built, and massive buildings in the socialist realist style were erected, some you can even spot inside the city center. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Following the fall of communism, the industries which provided jobs to many of Cluj’s inhabitants have failed. Skyrocketing inflation and notorious ponzi schemes mark this period in the city’s history.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Recovery started in the 2000’s, when industry was replaced by an economy based on services, finance and a highly educated workforce. The city received considerable foreign investment and the economy was boosted by the arrival of students from all regions of the country and from abroad. The estimated number of a hundred thousand students attending the many universities of this city make it today one of the most vibrant places in Romania.</p>
